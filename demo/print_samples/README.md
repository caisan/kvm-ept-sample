# DEMO 1. print_samples
### -- sample the memory accesses of a given QEMU-KVM instance and print them
This demo is the simplest one to show how to use the APIs provided by kvm-ept-sample. To build it, go into *demo* directory, and run `make print_samples`. Run `print_samples <pid>` to lanuch it, where <pid> is the the PID of a QEMU-KVM process.
