# DEMO 1. print_samples
### sample the memory accesses of a given QEMU-KVM instance and print them
This demo is the simplest one to show how to use the APIs provided by kvm-ept-sample. Run `make` to build it. Run `print_samples <pid>` to lanuch it, where <pid> is the the PID of a QEMU-KVM process. Then you will see all sampled accesses.
